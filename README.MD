# Make a 1v1 or 1vCPU game based off of the Big Bang Theory's Rock, Paper, Scissor, Spock, Lizard game. User can select what mode and how many rounds it can go up to.

# Although the full project isn't finished yet, what I did interact with worked exactly as it should have. I liked the font and the dynamic background that the webpage used, makes the website stand out versus others. I also liked the rules pop up after you select the set and who I was versing. The bobbing arrow on the game page itself is really cool too.  All the project needs is the logic for the actual game part of it to work and it should be all good.
